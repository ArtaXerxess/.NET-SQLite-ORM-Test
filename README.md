# SQLite ORM Notes

## Aim
To develop a simple .NET console application that establishes a SQLite connection and performs basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using the sqlite-net-pcl library.

## Theory
SQLite is a self-contained, serverless, and transactional SQL database engine. It is widely used for embedded database systems due to its lightweight nature and ease of use. SQLite does not require a separate server process, making it a popular choice for applications needing a simple, local storage solution.

In this lab, we will use the sqlite-net-pcl library, a popular SQLite library for .NET, to interact with an SQLite database. The sqlite-net-pcl library provides a simple and efficient way to perform database operations from within a .NET application.

The basic CRUD operations that will be performed are as follows:

Create: Inserting new records into a table.

Read: Retrieving records from a table.

Update: Modifying existing records in a table.

Delete: Removing records from a table.

## Conclusion
By completing this lab, students will gain hands-on experience in integrating an SQLite database with a .NET console application using the sqlite-net-pcl library. They will understand how to establish a database connection and perform basic CRUD operations. This practical experience will help them in developing applications that require local data storage and management.
